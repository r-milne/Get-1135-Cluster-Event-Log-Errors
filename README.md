.DESCRIPTION

Script was initially created to review the number of 1135 cluster errors that are reported into the system event log of the Exchange servers that are in a Database Available group (DAG).  A DAG sits atop of a failover cluster and if a DAG member experiences a 1135 error then all databases  that were active on the server will be moved to another member in the DAG. 
 
Script can report to the screen the number of 1135 errors per server.  If required you can modify to output to a  CSV using standard methods. 


.ASSUMPTIONS

Script is being executed with sufficient permissions to retrieve eventlog entries on the server(s) targeted.

 You can live with the Write-Host cmdlets :)

 You can add your error handling if you need it.
